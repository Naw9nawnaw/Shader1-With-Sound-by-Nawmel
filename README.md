The conventional CPU-intensive audio reactive visualizer's performance limitations prompted me to independently investigate and explore Shaders (including both Vertex and Fragment Shaders; their integration within p5.js presented a bit of a challenge). I eagerly anticipate future opportunities to utilize OpenGL Shading Language to produce interactive sound and visual arts.
